# The Better Context App

```
bun add -g btca@latest
```

```
btca ask -t svelte -q "How does the inspect rune work?"
```

**out of the box this uses grok code from open code because it's free, but if you have opencode installed you can customize the model and provider in the config file at ~/.config/btca/btca.json**

I recommend haiku 4.5...

```json
{
  "promptsDirectory": "~/.config/btca/prompts",
  "reposDirectory": "~/.config/btca/repos",
  "port": 3420,
  "maxInstances": 5,
  "repos": [
    {
      "name": "svelte",
      "url": "https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte.dev",
      "branch": "main"
    },
    {
      "name": "effect",
      "url": "https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect",
      "branch": "main"
    },
    {
      "name": "nextjs",
      "url": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js",
      "branch": "canary"
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
  "provider": "anthropic"
}
```

This is an evolution of: https://github.com/bmdavis419/opencode-hosted-docs-nonsense. Eventually I want to have this be the easiest way to pass in a piece of tech (ie. Svelte) and a question (ie. "How do remote functions work?") and get an up to date answer based on the latest version of the tech using the latest version of the docs/source code...

**_this is all scratch work right now, I'll remove this once it's more ready to go_**

## Installation

```sh
bun i
```

## Development

Run CLI commands from the repo root:

```sh
# Show help
bun run cli --help

# Ask a question
bun run cli:ask -t <tech> -q "<question>"

# Start HTTP server
bun run cli:serve -p <port>

# Hold open instance in background
bun run cli:open
```

### CLI - Ask a question

Ask a question about a specific technology directly from the command line:

```sh
bun run cli:ask -t <tech> -q "<question>"
```

Example:

```sh
bun run cli:ask -t effect -q "How does Effect.tap work?"
```

### HTTP Server

Start the HTTP server to accept questions via API:

```sh
bun run cli:serve -p <port>
```

Example:

```sh
bun run cli:serve -p 8080
```

Then make POST requests to `/question`:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/question \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tech":"effect","question":"How does Effect.tap work?"}'
```

Response:

```json
{ "answer": "..." }
```

### Help

```sh
bun run cli --help
bun run cli:ask --help
bun run cli:serve --help
```
